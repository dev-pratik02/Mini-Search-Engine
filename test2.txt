Databases store and retrieve structured data efficiently for applications.
SQL is the standard language used to query and manage relational databases.
Indexing in databases speeds up search queries significantly on large datasets.
A primary key uniquely identifies each record inside a database table.
Transactions in databases ensure data consistency through commit and rollback operations.
Operating systems manage hardware resources and provide services to running programs.
Process scheduling algorithms decide which program the CPU executes next.
Memory management in operating systems involves paging and segmentation techniques.
File systems organize data storage and retrieval on disk drives efficiently.
Deadlocks occur when two programs wait indefinitely for each other to release resources.
The kernel is the core component of every operating system managing hardware access.
Virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than physically available on hardware.
Cache memory stores frequently accessed data close to the CPU for faster retrieval.
Database normalization reduces redundancy and improves data integrity across tables.
Search and indexing algorithms are critical for both databases and operating systems.
